# Jesus Cleans the River

This is a small 2d game we made in a small group.

### How to run the game

**In order to run the game you need to install pygame:**

```$ pip install pygame```

If this gives you errors regarding external managed environments, create a virtual environment in the cloned repo's root:

```$ virtualenv <name>```

```$ <name>/bin/activate``` 

```$ pip install pygame```

Now you can run the game using:
```$ python3 Main.py```

### Gameplay

Jesus is the character on the Bridge. His task is to catch the trash which is moving towards him. However he should not catch the fish.
If Jesus lets too much trash get past the bridge or if he catches too many fish the wate-o-meter is moving towards the red area. When the waste-o-meter reaches the maximum the game is over.
But he can also move the waste-o-meter towards the green area agin, when he catches trash.


### Controls
Jesus can be controlled via *A* and *D* or *left_arrow* and *right_arrow* on the keyboard.
