# JESUS CLEANS THE RIVER
This is a small 2d game we made in a small group.

# Gameplay
Jesus is the character on the Bridge. He is supposed to catch the trash which is swimming in the river but not the fish. <br>
If Jesus lets too much trash get past the bridge or if he catches too much fish the wast speedometer is moving towards the red area. When the speedometer reaches the maximum the game is over. <br>
However if he catches more trash, the speedometer is going towards the green are again.

# Controls
Jesus can be controlled via A and D or left_arrow and right_arrow on the keyboard.
