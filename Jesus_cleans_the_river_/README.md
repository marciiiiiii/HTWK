# Jesus Cleans the River

This is a small 2d game we made in a small group.

### How to run the game

**In order to run the game you need to install pygame:**

```$ pip install pygame```

If this gives you errors regarding external managed environments, create a virtual environment in the cloned repo's root:

```$ virtualenv <name>```

```$ <name>/bin/activate``` 

```$ pip install pygame```

Now you can run the game using:
```$ python3 Main.py```

### Gameplay

Jesus is the character on the Bridge. He is supposed to catch the trash which is swimming in the river but not the fish.
If Jesus lets too much trash get past the bridge or if he catches too much fish the wast speedometer is moving towards the red area. When the speedometer reaches the maximum the game is over.
However if he catches more trash, the speedometer is going towards the green are again.
Controls

Jesus can be controlled via A and D or left_arrow and right_arrow on the keyboard.
